# ⏱️ Time Guessing Game – My First React Project

This is a small browser-based game I built to teach myself the **basics of React**. The idea behind the game is simple:  
The user must guess when a target amount of time (e.g. 5 seconds) has passed by clicking a button – no timer, no countdown, just your inner feeling for time!

This project helped me understand and apply key React concepts like **state management**, **event handling**, and **conditional rendering**.

## 📸 Gameplay Description

1. User sees a "Start" button
2. Once clicked, a timer starts running **in the background**
3. The user must click "Stop" when they _think_ a certain number of seconds has passed
4. The app then tells them how close (or far off) their guess was

A fun and lightweight way to practice **thinking in React**!
